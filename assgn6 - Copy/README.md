The new features on my page can be experienced on the blackberry product details page:
  Both dropdowns are interactable, and depending on what quantity the user chooses, the total cost at the bottom will update with the correct price.
  Once a user hits the "add to cart button," the item counter by the shopping cart icon in the navigation bar will update and increase with every click.
  
The new shopping cart page is not yet reflective of what users add to their carts, but the general layout and presentation is complete. The "continue shopping" link works in that if a user clicks it, it links the user back to the menu page.
